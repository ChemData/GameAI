Game
   A game is something like tictactoe. Players interact with each other and the game.

GameState
   This records the current state of a game. It might include the position of pieces, the amount of money each player has, etc.

Player
    An entity which decides which moves to take in the game. A player consists of a set of algorithms for choosing moves at each decision point.

    An action taken at a decision point.
    

DecisionPoint
    A point in the game where a player must make a decision. A game might have a single type of decision point (e.g. in tic tac toe the only decision to make is where to place your mark). A game might have multiple sets of decision points (e.g. in Catan, the player decides where/if to build a road and what resource trade to offer.) Each decision point requires a different picking model.
