How do you deal with unknown or partially known information?
    1) Something no player can know: what card is on top of a deck
    2) Something some players know: What card is in player A's hand
    3) Something a player could know if they had a good memory: What are all the cards in player A's deck

    Perhaps a function which takes in a GameState and player number and returns only the information that player knows.


Code issues
    - There is an issue with Zygote (part of Flux) when I try to add an L2 regularization term to the loss function. This term requires summing over the models parameters. For some reason I get the error "Mutating arrays is not supported". This didn't happen with an older verion of Julia/Flux. No clue what the problem is.
